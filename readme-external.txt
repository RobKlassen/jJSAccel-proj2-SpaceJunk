//  ALRIGHT.  SO I HAD SOME TROUBLE FINDING AN API I REALLY LIKED, AND ULTIMATELY
//  I'M NOT 100% HAPPY WITH THE ONES I CHOSE, I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE
//  BIT SIMPLE, AND PARTICULARLY, I'M NOT USING AN API TO FEED INFORMATION INTO
//  ANOTHER API.  MY ORIGINAL PLAN WAS TO HAVE AN ISS TACKING API FEED INFORMATION
//  INTO ANOTHER NASA API THAT COULD PRODUCE SATELLITE IMAGERY FROM THE ISS' LOCATION
//  BUT IT TURNS OUT INSERTING COORDINATE INFORMATION RELIABLY IS VERY DIFFICULT...
//
//  SO, WHAT I SETTLED ON IS A COLLECTION OF SPACE THEMED APIs THAT I THINK I'M 
//  USING IN VARIOUS WAYS. THE PROGRAM IS SPLIT INTO 3 PARTS:
//  
//  1. THE FIRST SECTION IS TAKING INFORMATION FROM AN API THAT IS A COLLECTION
//      OF SOLAR SYSTEM OBJECT DATA.  I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE KIND OF NEAT TO 
//      USE THE SIZE INFORMATION OF THOSE OBJECTS TO RENDER -TO SCALE- VERSIONS
//      OF THOSE CELESTIAL BODIES.  SOMEHOW I THINK I ACTUALLY MADE THAT WORK, 
//      THE ONLY THING I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT IS HOW TO CALCULATE THE SCALE ON
//      THE FLY.  FOR THE FIRST 'SCALE TO LARGEST' OR 'SCALE TO SMALLEST' HOWEVER, 
//      IT IS 100% ACCURATE IN CALCULATING THE PIXEL / KILOMETER RATIO.  AND,
//      THE ACTUAL VISUAL SCALE OF THE OBJECTS IS CORRECT WITHIN THE ACCURACY OF
//      JAVASCRIPTS TERRIBLE FLOATING POINTS.  
//
//      THE 5 BUTTONS ON THE APP LET YOU GENERATE NEW CELESTIAL BODIES, SCALE THEM 
//      BOTH UP OR DOWN PROPORTIONALLY BY A SET PERCENTAGE, AND THEN THE LAST 
//      TWO SCALE BOTH OBJECTS PROPORTIONALLY TO EITHER THE LARGER OR SMALLER ONE. 
//      
//      IT ALSO GENERATES SOME OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PLANETS, BECAUSE THAT
//      PART IS EASY COMPARED TO ACTUALLY RENDERING SIZES PROPERLY.
//      
//      I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO ACTUALLY BUILD SORTS SO BORING OBJECTS GET FILTERED 
//      OUT... SO ABOUT 75% OF THE OBJECTS GENERATED ARE JUST BIG ASTEROIDS. ALSO,
//      IT TURNS OUT THAT THE SIZE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BODIES (WHEN RENDERED TO SCALE)
//      IS ACTUALLY HILARIOUSLY FAR OFF IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, SO A LOT OF THE
//      TIME THE OBJECTS SEEM TO BE FLAT SURFACES OR SINGLE PIXELS UNTIL SCALED.
//      
//  2.  THE SECOND MODULE IS VERY SIMPLE, IT ACCESSES NASA'S AWESOME "ASTRONOMY      
//      PICTURE OF THE DAY" API THAT IS VERY SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD.  IT EVEN
//      HAS A BUILT IN RANDOM FUNCTION.  IT'S HONESTLY SO SIMPLE THAT I FELT BAD
//      USING IT, WHICH WAS MY VERY FIRST ATTEMPT AT AN API FOR PROJECT 2.  
//      
//      IT ALSO SETS THE IMAGE TO GRAYSCALE TO LINE UP THE VISUAL AESTHETIC OF MY
//      PROGRAM.  
//      
//  3.  THE THIRD MODULE IS HALF THE PROTOTYPE I MADE FOR MY FIRST 'BETTER' ATTEMPT 
//      AT AN API PROJECT.  I MANAGED TO FIGURE OUT THE MATH AND CONVERSIONS TO TAKE
//      THE ISS' LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE AND PROJECT IT ONTO A MAP AS A DOT.   
//      
//      AS FAR AS API USAGE IS CONCERNED, IT'S ALSO QUITE SIMPLE, SO I WANTED TO
//      APPLY IT IN AN INTERESTING WAY.  CURRENTLY IT UPDATES EVERY 2 SECONDS.
//
